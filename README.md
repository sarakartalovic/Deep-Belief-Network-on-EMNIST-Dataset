In this project, I will explore Deep Belief Networks (DBN) which components are two or more Restricted Boltzmann Machines(RBM). 
The data set that will be used is EMNIST which containt digits and letters. In particular, I will use the balanced version while testing the models since it is the most applicable. 
Sample of the data:

1. Firstly, the dataset will be explored with two different dimensionality reduction techniques for representing multi-dimensional data to make better sense of data.
2. Then, the experiment will continue with exploring different parameters of DBN and continue with the development of a deeper version.
3. After finding the most suitable model, the internal representation developed by the model will be analyzed by studying the feature visualization and hierarchical clustering.
4. Next, the linear read-outs will be performed at different levels of the model to discover if the representations develop into less entangled at the deepest stages in the network.
5. In the end, the model will be evaluated, the accuracy will be computed and the confusion matrix will be analyzed in order to determine the type of the errors that model made.
